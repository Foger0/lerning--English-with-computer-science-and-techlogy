Although pure functions have strict conditions, such as not yield side effects or change behavior overtime, they can be composed more reliably into nested expressions and compound call expressions. As seen in the non-pure function example above that print does not return a useful result when used in an operand expression. The non-pure function always be used in some special situations. Moreover, it is much easier to debug the pure function. For these reasons, it is better to design more pure functions whenever possible. \n","</details>\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.1"},"orig_nbformat":4},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
